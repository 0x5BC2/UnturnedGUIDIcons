# Unturned Icons Repository

This repository contains PNG files of icons where the file names are GUIDs corresponding to each item.

## Structure

- The icons are stored in the `Results` directory.
- Each icon file is named using a GUID, which uniquely identifies the item it represents.

## Usage

You can use these icons in your projects by referencing the GUID-named PNG files.

## Example

If you have an item with the GUID `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`, you can find its corresponding icon in the `Results` directory as `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000.png`.
